## Description of Dataset:
Our database contains details of Shark Incidents occuring in California from (1950-2022) obtained through the [US Data Government Website](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset). Our database includes thirteen dimensions with various datatypes that specifies information regarding a specific shark incident and the details regarding the incident such as location, date, and severity of the injury. 

**Dimensions Include**: Incident Number (which represents the specific incident id), Time, Country, Location, Mode (which represents the activity that was taking place), Injury, Depth, Species, Comment and Confirmed Source——which are all of the datatype String. Additionally other dimensions include Date that the incident occured (Date datatype), and Longtitude and Latitude (number/decimal datatype) which specify the exact coordinates of where the shark incident happened——while they are of numerical value they still behave like a dimension because when combined those values point to a specific location and acts as a category rather than a measure. 




## Question 1:
**Which activities are associated with the highest number of shark incidents over the years? For the activities with the most shark incidents, how have their incident trends changed over time?**

## Question 2:
**How are the severity levels (fatal, major, and minor) of shark incidents geographically distributed along the California coast?**

## The manipulations applied to the data set as part of the analysis:
